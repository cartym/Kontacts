# Kontacts
A basic contacts application for Android using Kotlin

This application is for viewing, adding, and editing contacts on an Android device. 

After the announcement of Kotlin as an officially supported language I wanted to create a simple application try the language with.
This application is created to test out different different parts of Android programming including UI design, Objects, creation, editing, deletion, system persistance, and permissions.

The idea for this application is based on the Android example project:
